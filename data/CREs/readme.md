## Candidate cis-regulatory elements (CRE) datasets

All CREs correspond to distal regions (> 1kb from any transcription start site). Genome reference of human CREs is hg19, the genome reference for mouse CREs is mm10. dm3 and danRer10 are the genome references for fruit fly and zebrafish CRE, respectively. 

The following datasets are included:

#### * Mouse E8.25

#### * Mouse E8.5

#### * Human cell lines

#### * Human fetal

#### * Human hematopoiesis

#### * Adult zebrafish

#### * Fly S2 cells
