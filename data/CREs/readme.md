## Candidate cis-regulatory elements (CRE) datasets

All CREs correspond to distal regions (> 1kb from any transcription start site). CREs overlapping exons were removed. The genome reference for human CREs is hg19, while the genome reference for mouse CREs is mm10. For fruit fly and zebrafish CREs, the genome references are dm3 and danRer10, respectively. CREs were trimmed (keeping their center) to ensure a consistent width in each dataset.


The following datasets are included:

* Mouse E8.25: CREs specific to 17 E8.25 embryonic cell types [1].
* Mouse E8.5: CREs specific to 17 E8.5 embryonic cell types [2].
* Human cell lines: CREs specific to 6 cell lines [3].
* Human fetal: CREs specific to 34 fetal cell types across 15 organs [4].
* Human hematopoiesis: CREs specific to 24 blood and bone marrow cell types [5].
* Adult zebrafish: CREs specific to 11 adult tissues [6]. 
* Fly S2 cells: Developmental and housekeeping CREs in fruit fly S2 cells. Activity values of these CREs in activating a developmental or housekeeping promoter are included [7].
