# BOM
a machine learing method for cell-type specific enhancer prediction.
It achieved high performance for both binary classification and multi-class prediction.

## Installation

## Usage

You can used our pretrained BOM model to do prediction directly, or you can train a model for your own datasets.

### prediction with our pre-trained model

Add how to use pretrain model for prediction

### train model on your own data

- Model for binary classification

- Model for multi-class prediction



### Method Comparison

We conducted extensive comparison with the-state-of-art deeplearing methods (Basset; DeepSTARR; DeepMEl; DNAbert) and machine-learing methods(gkm-SVM). More details of comparison can be found in the Method_Comparison Folder.
